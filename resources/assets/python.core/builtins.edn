See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), 'x' for exclusive creation and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: Character Meaning 'r' open for reading (default) 'w' open for writing, truncating the file first 'x' open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists 'a' open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists 'b' binary mode 't' text mode (default) '+' open for updating (reading and writing) The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt'). Modes 'w+' and 'w+b' open and truncate the file. Modes 'r+' and 'r+b' open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when 't' is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as str, the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. There is an additional mode character permitted, 'U', which no longer has any effect, and is considered deprecated. It previously enabled universal newlines in text mode, which became the default behaviour in Python 3.0. Refer to the documentation of the newline parameter for further details. Note Python doesn’t depend on the underlying operating system’s notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows: Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE. On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long. “Interactive” text files (files for which isatty() returns True) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with codecs.register_error() is also valid. The standard names include: 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect. 'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss. 'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '?') to be inserted where there is malformed data. 'surrogateescape' will represent any incorrect bytes as code points in the Unicode Private Use Area ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These private code points will then be turned back into the same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding. 'xmlcharrefreplace' is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference &#nnn;. 'backslashreplace' replaces malformed data by Python’s backslashed escape sequences. 'namereplace' (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with \\N{...} escape sequences. newline controls how universal newlines mode works (it only applies to text mode). It can be None, '', '\\n', '\\r', and '\\r\\n'. It works as follows: When reading input from the stream, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\\n', '\\r', or '\\r\\n', and these are translated into '\\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated. When writing output to the stream, if newline is None, any '\\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If newline is '' or '\\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any '\\n' characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is False and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be True (the default) otherwise an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with (file, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as opener results in functionality similar to passing None). The newly created file is non-inheritable. The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the os.open() function to open a file relative to a given directory: >>> import os\n>>> dir_fd = os.open('somedir', os.O_RDONLY)\n>>> def opener(path, flags):\n...     return os.open(path, flags, dir_fd=dir_fd)\n...\n>>> with open('spamspam.txt', 'w', opener=opener) as f:\n...     print('This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt', file=f)\n...\n>>> os.close(dir_fd)  # don't leak a file descriptor\n The type of file object returned by the open() function depends on the mode. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w', 'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a subclass of io.TextIOBase (specifically io.TextIOWrapper). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of io.BufferedIOBase. The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an io.BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an io.BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns an io.BufferedRandom. When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of io.RawIOBase, io.FileIO, is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as, fileinput, io (where open() is declared), os, os.path, tempfile, and shutil. Raises an auditing event open with arguments file, mode, flags. The mode and flags arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call. Changed in version 3.3: The opener parameter was added. The 'x' mode was added. IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError. FileExistsError is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ('x') already exists. Changed in version 3.4: The file is now non-inheritable. Deprecated since version 3.4, will be removed in version 3.9: The 'U' mode. Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). The 'namereplace' error handler was added. Changed in version 3.6: Support added to accept objects implementing os.PathLike. On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of io.RawIOBase other than io.FileIO."} {:name "ord", :args ["c"], :doc "Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character.

The two-argument form pow(base, exp) is equivalent to using the power operator: base**exp. The arguments must have numeric types. With mixed operand types, the coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For int operands, the result has the same type as the operands (after coercion) unless the second argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are converted to float and a float result is delivered. For example, 10**2 returns 100, but 10**-2 returns 0.01. For int operands base and exp, if mod is present, mod must also be of integer type and mod must be nonzero. If mod is present and exp is negative, base must be relatively prime to mod. In that case, pow(inv_base, -exp, mod) is returned, where inv_base is an inverse to base modulo mod. Here’s an example of computing an inverse for 38 modulo 97: >>> pow(38, -1, mod=97)\n23\n>>> 23 * 38 % 97 == 1\nTrue\n Changed in version 3.8: For int operands, the three-argument form of pow now allows the second argument to be negative, permitting computation of modular inverses.

Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end. The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.

Any integer value is valid for ndigits (positive, zero, or negative). The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None. Otherwise the return value has the same type as number. For a general Python object number, round delegates to number.__round__. Note The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68.

To declare a static method, use this idiom: class C:\n    @staticmethod\n    def f(arg1, arg2, ...): ...\n The @staticmethod form is a function decorator – see Function definitions for details. A static method can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an instance (such as C().f()). Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also see classmethod() for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class constructors. Like all decorators, it is also possible to call staticmethod as a regular function and do something with its result. This is needed in some cases where you need a reference to a function from a class body and you want to avoid the automatic transformation to instance method.

This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object-or-type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type. For example, if __mro__ of object-or-type is D -> B -> C -> A -> object and the value of type is B, then super() searches C -> A -> object. The __mro__ attribute of the object-or-type lists the method resolution search order used by both getattr() and super(). The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, isinstance(obj, type) must be true. If the second argument is a type, issubclass(type2, type) must be true (this is useful for classmethods). There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that this method have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: class C(B):\n    def method(self, arg):\n        super().method(arg)    # This does the same thing as:\n                               # super(C, self).method(arg)\n In addition to method lookups, super() also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that super() is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as super().__getitem__(name). It does so by implementing its own __getattribute__() method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, super() is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as super()[name]. Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, super() is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.

This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks. zip() should only be used with unequal length inputs when you don’t care about trailing, unmatched values from the longer iterables.

This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced (by importing the builtins module and assigning to builtins.__import__) in order to change semantics of the import statement, but doing so is strongly discouraged as it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302) to attain the same goals and does not cause issues with code which assumes the default import implementation is in use. Direct use of __import__() is also discouraged in favor of importlib.import_module(). The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name. The standard implementation does not use its locals argument at all, and uses its globals only to determine the package context of the import statement. level specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports. 0 (the default) means only perform absolute imports. Positive values for level indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the directory of the module calling __import__() (see PEP 328 for the details). When the name variable is of the form package.module, normally, the top-level package (the name up till the first dot) is returned, not the module named by name. However, when a non-empty fromlist argument is given, the module named by name is returned. For example, the statement import spam results in bytecode resembling the following code: spam = __import__('spam', globals(), locals(), [], 0)\n The statement import spam.ham results in this call: spam = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), [], 0)\n Note how __import__() returns the toplevel module here because this is the object that is bound to a name by the import statement. On the other hand, the statement from spam.ham import eggs, sausage as saus results in _temp = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), ['eggs', 'sausage'], 0)\neggs = _temp.eggs\nsaus = _temp.sausage\n Here, the spam.ham module is returned from __import__(). From this object, the names to import are retrieved and assigned to their respective names. If you simply want to import a module (potentially within a package) by name, use importlib.import_module().
